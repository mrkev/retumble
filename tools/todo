API changes:

- Go through and figure what to change delete
- Notes is an Option(Number)
- Timestamp is a Date
- Every field is a getter
- can I have a field be both a getter and a function: ie
  Player, and Plyaer({width: 200, height: 200})?
  (should I just have player be 100% width and height?)
- Define a common API for posts maybe?
- Flow types would be nice. How can I expose them?
